1. VisionBoard image appearance (without hover) DONE but doesn't work in some cases. TODO: investigate

3. Add YouTube label to visionBoard

7. Create RAMKA for play, pause and settings buttons - DONE for play, pause and settings (check please - I don't like :( ) 
- Ashot: Please change play button's borders to be thin(is it possible?) just to separate button and background, currently they seem thick.
Or maybe color difference makes border to appear thicker then it is?

10. JLabel background 
(which was work in JDK 1.7 and not working in JDK 1.6) - DONE for text, but image not working still :(
ASHOT: what you want to do for image? Just make the panel's (I think you show it in jpanel) size as picture's one.

18. Should adding/removing new items to/from checked category also add/remove items from visionboard?
